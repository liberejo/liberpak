# liberpak

Liberpak is [Liberejo](https://github.com/liberejo/liberejo)'s core package.

## Setup

As the Liberejo core repository is not yet published, you will need to compile and install it locally using `gradle install`.

Then to build Liberpak, use `gradle build` and move the compiled JAR to your Liberejo package directory (`~/.local/share/liberejo/packages` on Linux).

Once the package system in Liberejo is more complete, a more seamless development testing environment will be created.
